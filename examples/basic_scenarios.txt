==== SCENARIO 1: GRANDFATHER PARADOX ====
A time traveler goes back in time and prevents their grandfather from meeting their grandmother. 
This would prevent the time traveler's parent from being born, which in turn would prevent the time traveler from being born.
If the time traveler was never born, they could not go back in time to prevent their grandparents from meeting.
Questions to analyze:
- Would the time traveler cease to exist immediately?
- Would this create an alternate timeline?
- Could this form a stable time loop where the universe "resets"?

==== SCENARIO 2: BOOTSTRAP PARADOX ====
A physicist receives plans for a time machine from an elderly visitor. The physicist builds the machine,
and when they're old, travels back in time to give the plans to their younger self.
Questions to analyze:
- Where did the plans originally come from?
- Is this a stable causal loop?
- What happens to information/entropy in this scenario?

==== SCENARIO 3: PREDESTINATION PARADOX ====
A detective is trying to catch a criminal. They receive a tip from the future about where the criminal will be.
They go there and in the ensuing chaos, accidentally create the very situation that causes the criminal activity
they were trying to prevent.
Questions to analyze:
- Was the event inevitable?
- Do the detective's actions create a deterministic loop?
- Is there any way to break the cycle?

==== SCENARIO 4: MULTIPLE TIMELINES SCENARIO ====
A scientist creates a time machine and travels back one day to meet themselves.
Now there are two versions of the scientist coexisting.
Questions to analyze:
- What happens if one version dies?
- How would this affect the timeline moving forward?
- Would this create infinite copies if repeated?

==== SCENARIO 5: INFORMATION PARADOX ====
A student is struggling with a difficult math problem. Their future self travels back in time
and gives them the solution. The student grows up, and eventually travels back to give their
younger self the same solution.
Questions to analyze:
- Where did the solution originally come from?
- Is this different from the bootstrap paradox?
- How does this affect creative development and learning?

==== SCENARIO 6: CHANGING THE PAST ====
A person travels back in time to prevent a major disaster that killed thousands.
They succeed, creating a new timeline where those people lived.
Questions to analyze:
- What happens to the original timeline?
- Do the people in the new timeline have free will or are they following a predetermined path?
- What would happen if the time traveler tried to return to their "present"?

==== SCENARIO 7: MEETING YOUR FUTURE SELF ====
A person meets an older version of themselves who gives them specific instructions about life choices.
The person follows these instructions which leads them to eventually become the older self who goes back in time.
Questions to analyze:
- Is this person's life now deterministic?
- What happens if they choose to break the cycle?
- Can free will exist in this scenario?
